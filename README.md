# Hacktober2020

Hey everyone and thanks for checking out my repo for [Hacktoberfest 2020](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)!

I've created this repo so my fellow students over at the TeamTreehouse Front End techdegree get the opportunity to enjoy this event no matter their coding experience. So far I've created a few basic pages with very few styling and interactivity added. Feel free to add sections, change styling or help out on the JavaScript interactivity. I've added some comments in the js files with ideas on what you could add to the project but feel free to be creative and implement your own creativity in to it. 

I'm looking forward to see the end result of our project! If you got any questions or suggestions feel free to reach out :)
